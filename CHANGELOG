Version .9.7
    HUGE code overhaul:
        Optimized some code.
        100% remade the GUI by hand.  Now uses MiGLayout.  This should fix issues with some tabs not displaying correctly on some systems.
    GUI now has potential for alternate themes.
    Merged Server Config tab and GUI Config tab into new Configuration tab.
    Added a Theme tab which for now only houses the color changing and text size options.
    Added an Internal port field for increased compatibility and maybe easier to understand?
    Added a minimum resize size so that no components would never NOT show (With the default Nimbus theme).
    Fixed NullPointerException when trying to edit a task when no task was selected.
    Completely re-made the backup tab.
    The backup process is more efficient when zipping.  It no longer backs up to a folder first and then zips.  It just zips.
    Redid the progress bar to make more sense.  It is only used for backups now and it actually shows the progress.
    Added BukkitContrib/Spout compatibility.
    Added quite a number of additional checks to make sure new users understand better issues they are having with the Proxy.
    Any files missing at the time of backup will be removed from the file list.
    Removed spawn protection from server properties box
    Updated proxy for 1.8.1 but doesn't seem to work (not sure how to fix) :(
    Probably stuff I forgot about.

Version .9.6.1
    Fixed issue where GUI restart tasks would cause the server to stop immediately.
    Potentially fixed other cases where GUI would cause premature server stops

Version .9.6
    Dealt with selecting large directories to backup freezing the GUI... Switched to a simpler checking mode.  It's not as pretty/intuitive but it solves the problem.
    Fixed issue where the console would not cease scrolling in the correct situations.
    The config should now always save on GUI close, once again.
    Minor fix to the Proxy code.
    You may now start/stop the server during a backup.  Doing so will attempt to immediately cancel the backup operation.
    UPDATE: There is a bug in this version that causes the server to immediately stop after starting.

Version .9.5
    Fixed GUI freeze issue when issued a server restart in a number of cases.

Version .9.4
    MAJOR STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN THIS VERSION.  It is highly recommended you make backups before updating!
    Editing a Save Worlds task now work properly.
    The last digit of the seconds field in the console output for players connecting to the proxy is now present!
    Browsing for a java executable now actually saves the path/file that you selected.
    Made the GUI significantly more thread-safe.  This could clear up any random unpredictable issues.
    Darkened the light gray ascii escape sequence color code.
    Added a simple warning message to help clear up any confusion about issues binding ports.
    Web Interface now logs to a file called guiweb.log.
    Added a donate menu item. ;)
    GUI will now auto-detect a server jar if you have not yet set one.
    Messages in the console output from the GUI now have a more uniform look.
    GUI messages are now logged to a file called com.dumptruckman.pail.log.
    Fixed bug where scheduled tasks would not trigger with the in-game task command.
    Changed the response API for the web interface so that the first key:value pair contains only the success/error message.  This only affects Get Output and as such, puts the output in a new key:value pair with the key "Console Output".
    Web interface API now allows for partial successes.
    Added new API to the web interface:
        Execute task.
        Retrieve Task Names.
        Retrieve Task Details.
        Alternate output styles for Get Output:
            Line break only (<br />).
            Plain Text with new line options of CRLF, LFCR, CR, or LF.
    These changes to the Web Interface API WILL break the old version of the Sample PHP Web Interface.
    Included a new guilauncher.bat file.

Version .9.3
    You can now use the Delete key to remove entries from the task list and a task's warning list.
    Slightly reworked how input was sent to the server, perhaps fixing a bug some users reported.

Version .9.2
    The custom command buttons now work properly again.
    The last selected custom command button is now remembered.

    Added date/time to Proxy connection notices.
    Added in game help command.
    The server status text in the bottom left is now ONLY for server status.
    The GUI finally utilizes the progress bar (sort of). (When running a backup)
    Task entry dialog now has a properly titled border.
    Reversed the position of the Create/Cancel buttons on the Task Dialog to better reflect most other button layouts.
    Reversed the position of the Add/Cancel butons on the Server Warning Dialog to better reflect most other button layouts.
    Add buton on Server Warning Dialog nows reads Update when editing a Warning.
    Server Warnings appear in the list as either a Command or Message instead of just Message.
    Server Warning Dialog no longer accepts an empty Time field.
    Server Warning Dialog now has a properly titled border.
    Merged multiple warning lists which may result in better reliability.
    GUI only auto-creates a missing backup directory when a backup is run instead of every time the GUI starts.
    Backup paths are now saved just like everything else instead of ONLY when the save button on the backup tab is pressed.
    POSSIBLY fixed freezing/delay when checking/unchecking items on the backup tab.
    Merged multiple task lists which may result in better reliability.
    Added countdown timers to each (scheduled) task to show when it will next trigger.

Version .9.0
    Added op only in game commands with a default prefix of "!".  This is changeable in the GUI Config tab.  Note: You must be using the proxy server for these to work!
    Currently supported in game commands are:
        repeat - repeats the last command.
        task <task name> - executes task with specified name.
    Added Up to date menu which contains 3 options, link to support page, view change log, and download latest version link.

    Removed debugging text left in the GUI by accident in .8.2.

    Fixed issue where backups would not disable level saving.
